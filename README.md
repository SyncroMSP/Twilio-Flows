# Twilio-Flows
Example Twilio Studio Flows you can use to build awesome flows!

# How to use these
These Twilio Studio Flows are templates, so you will need to edit them to fit your needs. 
To make it easy, anything that you need to replace/edit will be prefaced with 'replace-me' for searchability. 
For example, if you see 'replace-me-subdomain', you will need to replace the string with your account subdomain for this to work.
